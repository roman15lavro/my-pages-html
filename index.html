		<h1 style="text-align:center;">Description</h1>
		<p> Sea buckthorn usually grows in the form of a bush 0.5 - 4 m tall. The root system is slightly muscular,
			superficial. The roots are long, threadlike, often give shoots-shoots, have glomeruli (so-called root
			cones), in which nitrogen-fixing bacteria settle.
			Her crown is spreading, but often sparse. The branches are long, spiny, densely flattened. Young shoots with
			small spherical buds, covered with silver scales.
			The plant is dioecious, that is, unisexual male and female flowers develop in it on different individuals.
			Male flowers are gathered in short, almost spherical inflorescences, spikelets on very short peduncles.
			Staminate flowers brownish, small with deeply divided perianth and four stamens, without petals. The uterine
			flowers are greenish, inconspicuous, with a tubular two-lobed perianth, sitting in the axils of the leaves.
			One patch, ovary upper.
			The fruit is an oval drupe (7-8 mm in length), juicy, smooth, shiny, yellowish or orange-red ball-shaped
			with a peculiar taste and aroma. The fruits sit densely, as if sticking a stem. Seeds (up to 5 mm in length)
			are black, shiny with a stream.</p>

		<p> Well propagated by cuttings. To do this, cut them 40 cm in length at the beginning of the growing season. In
			the dug stream (width - 10, depth - 30 cm) covered with a mixture of river sand and humus soil (1: 1),
			cuttings are buried at a distance of 3 cm from each other, leaving on top two buds (in the first years of
			the sea buckthorn gives a root root and grows slightly). The upper cut of the cuttings is greased with
			garden lime. For better rooting, cuttings are shaded and often watered. You can also propagate sea buckthorn
			seeds and seedlings. To store in the offspring of economically valuable traits and properties use a
			vegetative method of reproduction.</p>
