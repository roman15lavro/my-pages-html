					<h1>Description</h1>
					<p class="text"> Sea buckthorn usually grows in the form of a bush 0.5 - 4 m tall. The root system
						is slightly
						muscular,
						superficial. The roots are long, threadlike, often give shoots-shoots, have glomeruli (so-called
						root
						cones), in which nitrogen-fixing bacteria settle.
						>Her crown is spreading, but often sparse. The branches are long, spiny, densely flattened.
						Young shoots
						with
						small spherical buds, covered with silver scales.
						The plant is dioecious, that is, unisexual male and female flowers develop in it on different
						individuals.
						Male flowers are gathered in short, almost spherical inflorescences, spikelets on very short
						peduncles.
						Staminate flowers brownish, small with deeply divided perianth and four stamens, without petals.
						The uterine
						flowers are greenish, inconspicuous, with a tubular two-lobed perianth, sitting in the axils of
						the leaves.
						One patch, ovary upper.
						The fruit is an oval drupe (7-8 mm in length), juicy, smooth, shiny, yellowish or orange-red
						ball-shaped
						with a peculiar taste and aroma. The fruits sit densely, as if sticking a stem. Seeds (up to 5
						mm in length)
						are black, shiny with a stream.</p>

			<h2 id="planting">Reproduction</h2>
			<p class="text"> Well propagated by cuttings. To do this, cut them 40 cm in length at the beginning of the
				growing season. In
				the dug stream (width - 10, depth - 30 cm) covered with a mixture of river sand and humus soil (1: 1),
				cuttings are buried at a distance of 3 cm from each other, leaving on top two buds (in the first years
				of
				the sea buckthorn gives a root root and grows slightly). The upper cut of the cuttings is greased with
				garden lime. For better rooting, cuttings are shaded and often watered. You can also propagate sea
				buckthorn
				seeds and seedlings. To store in the offspring of economically valuable traits and properties use a
				vegetative method of reproduction.</p>
